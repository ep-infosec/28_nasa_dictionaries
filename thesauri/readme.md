**About thesauri**

Thesauri and controlled vocabularies mandate the use of predefined, authorized terms. The entries are often designed for drawing distinctions between similar words and assisting in choosing exactly the right word. Unlike dictionaries, they do not provide definitions.

The NASA Thesaurus contains the authorized NASA subject terms used to index and retrieve materials in the NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS).
