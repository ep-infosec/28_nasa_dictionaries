**About Dictionaries**

A dictionary contains an alphabetical list of words that includes the word meaning.

The Planetary Data System (PDS) Data Dictionary provides the definitions of PDS objects and keywords and *Concepts of Mathematics for Students of Physics and Engineering: A Dictionary* provides definitions of mathematical concepts.

Acronym dictionaries provide meanings of acronyms, but often not the context within which the acronyms are used. For example, CASI's *Acronym Dictionary* includes four possible meanings for the acronym ACE, but does not provide guidance to determine which is the proper meaning for a given situation.
