### About NASA Taxonomy 2.0

The bulk of the work on the taxonomy was completed between 2002 and 2004. It seems to have been last updated in 2007, but is possibly linked to work that is still active.

The main webpage for the taxonomy, as it appeared between March 21, 2009 and December 7, 2011, is available via the Library of Congress: [https://www.loc.gov/item/lcwa00099446/](https://www.loc.gov/item/lcwa00099446/).

The NASA Taxonomy 2.0 project goals included:
* Make it easy for various audiences to find relevant information from NASA programs quickly
* Comply with E-Government Act of 2002
* Be ready to participate in federal XML projects

**Files**

*rdf_metadata.dtd* is a simple document type definition (DTD) for an RDF-compliant metadata format. This format is not an official NASA standard, it is a recommendation from the NASA Taxonomy Project on what a NASA standard metadata format might look like. The format began with the Dublin Core Specification, added some of the Dublin Core extensions, and added new elements in a NASA namespace for fields whose values come from the NASA Taxonomy.

Simple Knowledge Organizing System (SKOS) files are included for each facet of the taxonomy.
